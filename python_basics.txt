A variable is place that you define to store a datem of information.

The four core data types that been introduced are Integer, String, Float and Boolean

The input function does not know automatically what to do with the characters that are given 
so it just keeps the characters as the string data type so we have convert it to the integer or float
type so that the arithmetic functions can be carried out using these data points.

print(f"{x} times {y} equals {z}")

Variable naming should always stay consistent with what patterns of upper and lower case are used (e.g. camelcase)

/ is the operator for division // is the operator for rounded down division

type returns what the data type of the refered variable is this can be helpful for determining compatability when doing funky processing between variables.

idk try shit till it works usually in the order of checking syntax, checking capitalisation, checking data types, checking function specifics.
or like just read what line the error is.
