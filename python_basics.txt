A variable is place that you define to store a datem of information.

The four core data types that been introduced are Integer, String, Float and Boolean

The input function does not know automatically what to do with the characters that are given 
so it just keeps the characters as the string data type so we have convert it to the integer or float
type so that the arithmetic functions can be carried out using these data points.
